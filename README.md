# ASS-Assembly
Alex-Shell-Script is shell script for linux operating system to convert assembly file [.asm, .s]  into executable files.
# How to Use

**if you want to compile without run output file**
```
./ass_assembly.sh filename
```
**if you want to compile and execute the output file**
```
./ass_assembly.sh filename run
```
# WAIT
*Do not write the format file after file name*
```
Instead of this go inside the script file and change format_original_asm`s value
```
